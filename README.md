Recruitment
We've been working hard since some time to be more agile, improve our skills and be able to delivery high quality software. In order to achieve those goals, recruitement is a key point for us. For that reason, we decided to redraw our recruitement process in order to find and evaluate high skilled people who have the same mindset we do.

Principles

Developers and Tech Leaders must be involved

Since developers are going to work directly with newcomers, they must be involved in the process. If someone who does not have good coding skills, doesn't like tests or doesn't worry about quality can slow down the whole team. For some applications, we suffer due lack of tests so we want people that will help us to "pay the debt" and not increase it.

Mindset over specific technical skills

For our technical interviews, we try to figure out what is the applicant's mindset. We think a good mindset is more difficult to achieve than mastering specific technologies, frameworks, etc. We are not saying knowledge is not important, we are saying that good mindset is more difficult to find than people who just master the framework of the momment. Following some useful questions on this matter:

Does he or she know agile, craftsmanship and devops?
Does he or she think tests are important?
Does he or she like to do pair-programming and collaborate with others?
Does he or she is capable to find simple solutions and explain it clearly?
Does he or she follow what's on the edge in terms of technology, practices, etc. (read articles, go to meetups, conferences, twitter, etc)?
Does he or she wants to progress?
Are you good at coding? Prove it!

From now one, we are asking to applicants to implement the solution for a coding exercice (kata) and send us the solution before the technical interview. With this simple exercice, we can verify who the applicant code (with tests, clean code, etc.) and the solution is a basis for discussions during the interview. Developers who love what they do appreciate this kind of interview.

Good attract good

By recruiting good developer, we will create a new culture with interesting exchanges and more quality. We beleave this will create a virtuous circle, and more good developer will come join us.

Conduct an interview

The first step is to write the job description. It is very important to be honest and put on it the good and bad parts. We try to work hard on the good parts, to tempt candidates to come for an interview. We mention clearly we are focusing on good mindset, agile and craftsmanship.
CVs start to arrive and we select among those we are interest on. Developers, technical leaders and managers should be involved on this step. We take into account the candidate's experience so that we don't expect perfect things from 2-3years experience candidate.
Once we have some selected CVs, we will ask candidates to give a solution for one kata we've chosen and send it to us. Link for some katas we use. We also ask them to rate themselves from 1 to 5 on a couple of techniques/frameworks (TDD, clean code, Spring, AngularJs, etc), so that we can take this into account when evaluating them.
When the solutions start arriving, developers are going to check them and decide if we invite the applicant for a technical interview.
During the technical interview generaly we:
Present the project, context and ambitions
Ask the applicant to present the solution he or she gave to the exercice
We exchange technically with him or her (asking questions regarding the exercice and maybe some other questions), keeping in mind the candidates experience. We also try to see if the self assesment the candidate did is matching more or less our standards to some extent (ex : somebody claiming to be good and experienced with TDD should have no issue playing around with mocks).
At the end, we ask if the applicant have some questions
This is a template, an example. Any teams is free to decide their own way since they follow the principles describe above.
